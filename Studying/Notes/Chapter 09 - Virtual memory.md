## Goals

Virtual memory allows us to isolate processes, so that they do not
corrupt each other. It achieves this by abstracting memory out to
virtual memory, and all processes share the same virtual memory space.
This also helps us utilize our limited physical memory more efficiently.

> The primary benefits of virtual memory include freeing applications from having to manage a shared memory space, increased security due to memory isolation, and being able to conceptually use more memory than might be physically available, using the technique of paging.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory)

## Concepts to learn

* Virtual address translation
* Paging and TLB
* Page table management
* Swap

## Virtual memory VM

> In computing, virtual memory is a memory management technique that is implemented using both hardware and software. It maps memory addresses used by a program, called virtual addresses, into physical addresses in computer memory. Main storage as seen by a process or task appears as a contiguous address space or collection of contiguous segments. The operating system manages virtual address spaces and the assignment of real memory to virtual memory.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory)

**Hardware support:**

>  Address translation hardware in the CPU, often referred to as a **memory management unit or MMU**, automatically translates virtual addresses to physical addresses.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory)

> A **Translation lookaside buffer (TLB)** is a memory cache that is used to reduce the time taken to access a user memory location.[1][2] It is a part of the chipâ€™s memory-management unit (MMU). The TLB stores the recent translations of virtual memory to physical memory and can be called an address-translation cache.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_lookaside_buffer)

**Operating system support:**

* The OS manages the MMU, and sometimes the TLB.
* The OS determines the address mapping

**Alternatives:**

* Many real-time operating systems don't have virtual memory.
