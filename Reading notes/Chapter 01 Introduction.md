Rachel's summary notes

## Vocabulary

* Operating System
* Hardware

* Asymmetric, symmetric multiprocessing
* Asymmetric, symmetric clustering
* Parallelization

## User's Point of View

* User cares about *ease of use*, not so much *resource utilization*.
* Several users may be connected to a single computer via a terminal, but not have to think about resource management of the *mainframe*.
* Users using *workstations* have to share resources lik enetworking, servers (file/compute/print servers).

## System's Point of View

* For a system, the OS is a resource manager.
* Computer sysems have multiple resources: CPU time, memory space, file-storage space, I/O devices.

## Storage Structure

* Each byte has its own address.
