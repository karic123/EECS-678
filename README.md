# EECS-678

Introduction to Operating Systems, Spring 2017

## Items

* [Studying notes](https://github.com/Rachels-studies/EECS-678/tree/main/Studying/Notes) - Notes taken while reading through the book, or studying for exams.
	* [Final exam overview](https://github.com/Rachels-studies/EECS-678/blob/main/Studying/Notes/2017-04-29%20Final%20Review.md) - My final exam study notes compiled based on review slides, trying to cover all the content from the review slides.
* [Code to solve problems](https://github.com/Rachels-studies/EECS-678/tree/main/Studying/Tools) - Application problems on the exams and quizzes; it wasn't clear to me how they should be solved by hand, so after figuring it out for myself, I wrote Python code to make the steps more clear.
* [Example code](https://github.com/Rachels-studies/EECS-678/tree/main/Studying/Coding-examples) - Example code for pipes, forking, multithreading, sockets, etc.

## Class tips

Here's what I learned during this class:

* Can't predict what will be on the midterm/final exams; can't only study the book or only study the slides - doing either/or got me a C on both the midterm and the final.
* Teacher likes to ask computational questions.
* Source code from the book is mostly useless, unless he puts it in the slides. e.g., I spent time learning code from the book for the Banker's Algorithm, but that wasn't referenced - it was calculations by hand.
* Work on projects solo; it is just simpler that way.
* Project documentation sucks, so make sure you ask questions to your TA.
* The teacher doesn't post the lecture slides before or during the class; usually they're up a week *after* the lecture, so have fun with that.

## Don't cheat off my stuff!

If you're having trouble with specific content, check out the **Studying/Coding-examples**
folder where I created some small, concise sample programs as I was
learning new topics.

Don't just copy my assignments - it is easy to find plagarism.

## Why put these things on GitHub?

Everybody has their own learning style. I teach computer science courses
at a community college, and a lot of my teaching style is based on the
frustrations I've had throughout my undergrad career.

Now that I'm in gradschool, I find the same frustrations; namely,
not having access to the resources that I would like to have.

Whenever there is a deficit in resources that I want, I create those resources.

So, essentially, I am self-learning. I'm not getting much out of the
course lectures themselves, so I go through the textbook and other
online resources - like Wikipedia - to learn more about the topics
that the teacher highlights.

I'm cataloging what I'm learning in my GitHub account.
This is mostly for my own future reference, but perhaps my notes or
example code (See the "Learning" folder) will help someone else grasp
these concepts.

## Obscurity isn't security

As a teacher myself, I have to acknowledge and accept that students are
going to share their resources. Sometimes certain students have access
to past students' exams or programs or whatever else. These students
can pass around their solutions between themselves as a resource that
is *not* afforded to all students of the class, giving an unfair advantage
based on connections rather than study skills.

Additionally, I know that I cannot stop students from sharing this 
information, online or offline. Some teachers make the students give
their exams back after they've seen their results, so that the teacher
can proceed to re-use those same exam questions every semester.

Although it does mean *a lot of work* for me as a teacher, I work to
make sure that not all of the assignments I give, semester-to-semester,
are the same items.

I also give my students access to example code, written by myself.

I also give my students all my slides, and record my lectures in video form.

I also give my students exams from previous semesters, or at least
study guides that I've written that highlight all of the important things
that I expect them to know - because it can be difficult for a student
to intuit what the teacher will expect them to know.

My teaching style is to not obscure anything. I have my students create
public GitHub accounts and post their work there. It isn't some dirty
secret that only some students know about. They know they're posting it
online, *I* know they're posting it online.

My teaching style is to give everybody a level playing field, and to let
them know specifically what I expect of my students. Trying to mind-read
the teacher's thoughts is not a fun game to be playing.
