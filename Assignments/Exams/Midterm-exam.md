# Exam 1, Spring 2017

11 questions, 100 points total

Average grade: 84%

My grade: 78%

## Suggested resources

I spent too much time reading through every page of all 7
chapters that were covered. I should have **reviewed the BB quizzes**
and based most of my studying off of the **slides**.

The teacher had told me the lecture slides and the book I should have
reviewed from, but I think that hurt me in the long run and I was
burnt out after a week of studying.
